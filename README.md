## Option 1 — Frontend Development

For contributors working on:

- UI/UX

- Client-side JavaScript

### Run Locally

```bash
# Using Node
npx serve .

# OR using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Niteshagarwal01/PYSCHECARE.git
cd PYSCHECARE
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Environment Variables

The server requires specific environment variables to run securely. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:

*   **Linux/macOS/Git Bash**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
*   **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
    ```cmd
    copy .env.example .env
    ```
*   **Windows (PowerShell)**:
    ```powershell
    Copy-Item .env.example .env
    ```

Open the newly created `.env` file and configure the following variables:
*   `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`: The client application's origin URL allowed to make requests via CORS (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost`).
*   `CHAT_API_SECRET`: A secure, random string/key used for signing and validating chat session tokens.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The Flask server will raise a fatal `ValueError` and fail to start if the `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` environment variable is not defined.

### Start Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will usually be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
